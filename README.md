## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below **10** that are multiples of **3** or **5**, we get **3**, **5**, **6** and **9**. The sum of these multiples is **23**.

Find the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below **1000**.

## 2. Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be:

<div align="center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... </div>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
